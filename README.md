# Parrallel-AES-128-using-OpenMP-and-CUDA

**Abstract:**
This report implements the application of parallel computing theories to the encryption task using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with the 128-bit key standard. Approaching from the theory of Counter Mode of the AES-128 algorithm, the feasibility of parallelizing the steps of: Keystream generation and XORing two matrices in the encryption process is recognized. By means of multithreaded execution on the CPU with OpenMP and parallel execution on the Tesla 4 GPU with CUDA kernels. Tests were performed using available modules in the OpenSSL library (C/C++) with parallelization on the CPU and GPU XOR kernel; constructing a simple AES128 module for parallelization on the GPU T4 Keystream generation and XOR kernel resulted in the conclusion that the method of parallelizing both keystream generation and XOR on the GPU T4 executes the fastest, with an average execution time for various file sizes (512KB, 10MB, 100MB, 500MB, 1GB, 3GB) of 502.7086ms, compared to the average execution time of the slowest method at 3057.9317ms.  
   
General conclusions: (1) Applying parallelization provides a good benefit in encryption according to the AES algorithm; (2) The number of threads per block has an impact on the execution speed, but a large number of threads is not necessarily suitable for large-sized files.
